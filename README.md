<center><h3> Assignment 2: Dueling-DQN and Monte-Carlo REINFORCE </h3></center>

This repository contains the code and report for the second assignment of the course CS6700: Reinforcement Learning. The assignment involves implementing the Dueling-DQN algorithm and the Monte-Carlo REINFORCE algorithm, each in 2 variants. The algorithms are then tested on the `CartPole-v1` and `Acrobot-v1` environments from the Gymnasium library.

The assignment was done as a team of 2 by [Aditya C (CS20B003)](https://github.com/AdityaC-003) and [Kruthic Vignesh M (CS20B045)](https://github.com/Kruthic-Vignesh).
